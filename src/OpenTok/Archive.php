/**
* Represents an archive of an OpenTok session.
*
* @property int $createdAt
* The time at which the archive was created, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
*
* @property string $duration
* The duration of the archive, in milliseconds.
*
* @property bool $hasVideo
* Whether the archive has a video track (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>).
*
* @property bool $hasAudio
* Whether the archive has an audio track (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>).
*
* @property string $id
* The archive ID.
*
* @property string $name
* The name of the archive. If no name was provided when the archive was created, this is set
* to null.
*
* @property string $outputMode
* The name of the archive. If no name was provided when the archive was created, this is set
* to null.
*
* @property string $partnerId
* The API key associated with the archive.
*
* @property string $reason
* For archives with the status "stopped", this can be set to "maximum duration
* exceeded", "maximum idle time exceeded", "session ended", "user initiated". For archives with
* the status "failed", this can be set to "failure".
*
* @property string $sessionId
* The session ID of the OpenTok session associated with this archive.
*
* @property string $size
* The size of the MP4 file. For archives that have not been generated, this value is set to 0.
*
* @property string $status
* The status of the archive, which can be one of the following:
*
* <ul>
*   <li> "available" -- The archive is available for download from the OpenTok cloud.</li>
*   <li> "expired" -- The archive is no longer available for download from the OpenTok
*         cloud.</li>
*   <li> "failed" -- The archive recording failed.</li>
*   <li> "paused" -- The archive is in progress and no clients are publishing streams to
*        the session. When an archive is in progress and any client publishes a stream,
*        the status is "started". When an archive is "paused", nothing is recorded. When
*        a client starts publishing a stream, the recording starts (or resumes). If all clients
*        disconnect from a session that is being archived, the status changes to "paused", and
*        after 60 seconds the archive recording stops (and the status changes to "stopped").</li>
*   <li> "started" -- The archive started and is in the process of being recorded.</li>
*   <li> "stopped" -- The archive stopped recording.</li>
*   <li> "uploaded" -- The archive is available for download from the the upload target
*        Amazon S3 bucket or Windows Azure container you set up for your
*        <a href="https://tokbox.com/account">OpenTok project</a>.</li>
* </ul>
*
* @property string $url
* The download URL of the available MP4 file. This is only set for an archive with the status set to
* "available"; for other archives, (including archives with the status "uploaded") this property is
* set to null. The download URL is obfuscated, and the file is only available from the URL for
* 10 minutes. To generate a new URL, call the Archive.listArchives() or OpenTok.getArchive() method.
